# @types/league
types package for league client

```
npm install github:vanillamaster/league-types
```
> ***TIP:*** use [`#semver:<semver>`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-install) syntax

## TODO
 - add declarations for more endpoints
 - write better readme
 - write type preformance tests

## Future of project
I'll add type declarations as they first appear in my projects,
so not much will be typed, but, its open source project,
so in best scenario peoples contribute to it enough to it be viable
